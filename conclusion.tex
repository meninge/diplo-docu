Experiences made during the internship show clearly that it is possible to reduce considerably the energy consumed by an out-of-the-shelf embedded platform running a streaming application on a standard software stack. Just with a basic heuristic, about \textbf{20\% of energy} was saved and with only 0,3\% of performance rise concerning to the throughput constraints. The experiment can also confirm that there are a strong link between the throughput constraint and the dynamic power consumption. These results are really encouraging for the future of the project. In a near future, Reinforcement learning could be tested instead of the basic heuristic, results are promising.
